# Click And Count

Free PHP script to track how many times a given link has been clicked.

Edit `data.txt` to configure which links to track. The first item is the link's ID, followed by the URL and the counter. You'll need to change your existing link(s) before you can count any clicks. See below for an example.

```
Old link: a href=http://www.example.com
New link: a href=/cac?id=exam
```

Point your browser to `stats.php` to view a summary.
